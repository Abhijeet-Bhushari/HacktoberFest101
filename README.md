A repository to help budding developers have their first commit!

Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

1. Hacktoberfest is a celebration open to everyone in our global community.
2. Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.
3. You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

## Guidelines to contribute

- Pull/merge requests can be submitted to any opted-in repository on GitHub or GitLab.
- The pull/merge request must contain commits you made yourself.
- If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.
- If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
- To get a prize, you must make at least four approved pull/merge requests (PRs/MRs) on opted-in projects between October 1st and 31st in any time zone.
- The first 40,000 participants (maintainers and contributors) who complete Hacktoberfest can elect to receive one of two prizes: a tree planted in their name, or the Hacktoberfest 2022 t-shirt.
